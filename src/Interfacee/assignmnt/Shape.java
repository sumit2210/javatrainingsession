//Assignment question :
//        Create interface called Shape which has method getName
//        Create interface Drawable which has method draw
//        Drawable should extend interface called Calculator
//        Calculator has method calculatePerimeter and calculateArea method
//
//        Create class Circle, Rectangle, and Square which implement both Shape and Drawable interfaces
//        Add required instance variables to Circle, Rectangle and Square class to calculate perimeter and area
//
//        Create object of circle and square and print call draw method and calculatePerimeter and Area method
//
//        hint : perimeter of circle is = 2 * 3.14 * radius
//        area of circle = 3.14 * radius * radius
//        peremeter of rectangle  = 2 * length + 2 * breadth
//        area of rectangle  = length * breadth
//        area of square = side * side
//        peremeter of square  = 4 * sides
//        area of square = side * side
